                    <p>
                        I began learning how to program my freshman year of college, taking relevant coursework during my time at the University of Rhode Island, such as Discrete Math, Data Structures, The Joy of Programming, Fundamentals of Programming, Computer Programming, and Programming with Data Science. I'm passionate about developing creative technology solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At URI, I've developed programming skills in Python, C++, C, SQL, and JavaScript, alongside several side projects using languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flutter, and Dart. I also work at the Academic Enhancement Center as a tutor at URI, where I help students with courses like Computer Programming, The Joy of Programming, and Fundamentals of Programming while honing my skills in Python, C++/C, and JavaScript. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through essential units covering the data science pipeline, data access and integration, exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and effective communication of findings, CSC 310, one of my classes at URI, offered a thorough introduction to data science and statistical thinking. 
                        I obtained practical experience working with a variety of datasets, conducting exploratory analysis and visualization, and developing and assessing machine learning models during the course. 
                        I solved data-driven problems using machine learning frameworks. I also looked into effective insight reporting, bias mitigation, and ethical issues.
                        Assignments that helped me better grasp fundamental ideas, projects that used these abilities to solve practical issues, and reports that effectively and professionally presented my results were all part of my work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Working in a variety of non-technology-related environments, such as a hospital, an auto shop, and being an intern for a nonprofit focused on clean energy, has improved my communication skills, given me the ability to thrive in demanding, high-stress work environments, and developed a motivated work ethic. 
                        I aim to work as a software engineer in a professional atmosphere and use my skills to break into the tech industry.
                        I also aim to work as a data engineer where I can leverage my analytical and technical skills
                        to uncover insights, utilize my expertise in AI and machine learning, and 
                        develop innovative solutions while prioritizing ethical practives in technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of school, I enjoy playing basketball, lifting weights, spending time with family, and learning new things.
