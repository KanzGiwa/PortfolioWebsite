                <h3>Fuelify</h3>
                <a href="https://gas-price-tracker-9sj6w7.flutterflow.app/">View the Fuelify App</a>
                <p>
                    As the Scrum Master for a team of four developers, I led the development of Fuelify, a full-stack Android application 
                    that helps users locate the lowest real-time gas prices by ZIP code.
                    Built using FlutterFlow and Dart, the app leverages a Firebase backend with services such as Authentication, Firestore Database, 
                    Analytics, Storage, Cloud Functions, A/B Testing, Remote Config, and Test Lab, along with external API integrations. 
                    I facilitated agile ceremonies to keep the cross-functional team aligned throughout development sprints and 
                    oversaw alpha testing to identify bugs, gather user feedback, and enhance app performance prior to the beta release. 
                    Additionally, I coordinated version control using GitHub, created Product Backlog Item (PBI) cards for issue tracking, 
                    and wrote detailed user stories to guide and streamline development tasks.

                <h3>Maternal Health Risk Machine Learning Project on Google Colab</h3>
                <a href="https://github.com/KanzGiwa/AI-ML-Projects">View my Machine Learning Project</a>
                <p>
                    I engineered a supervised classification model using Python and Google Colab to predict maternal health risk based on 1,014 mixed-type records. 
                    Through data preprocessing, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV, I optimized Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM algorithms, improving model accuracy by 62%. 
                    This project enabled me to identify key predictors of health risk and provide actionable insights for healthcare decision-making, deepening my ability to apply machine learning methods to real-world public health data.

                <p>The Quiz App is a fun and easy-to-use website where people can test their knowledge on a variety of topics, 
                    like history, entertainment, science, and more.
                    When someone opens the app, they're shown a series of multiple-choice questions. 
                    After answering all of them, they click a button to submit their answers and instantly seeing their feedback on the answers. 
                    Itâ€™s designed to be simple and engaging, making it great for casual learning, self-challenges, or just passing the time with interesting trivia.

                <h3>Fullstack Baking Website for Younger Sister and friends</h3>
                <a href="https://sweettreats-7jr0.onrender.com/">View the baking website</a>
                <p>
                    I built a website for my younger sister and her friends, allowing users to browse a menu of sweet treats and place orders seamlessly. 
                     
                    The website was developed using JavaScript, Python (Flask), HTML, and CSS, with Google Sheets serving as the backend database to store user orders.  
                    </p>
                    To integrate Google Sheets, I used Google Cloud Console to generate a service account JSON file containing the credentials needed for authentication and authorization via the Google Sheets API.  
                    
                    On the backend, Flask handled incoming JSON requests, extracting order details and securely saving them to Google Sheets, ensuring a smooth and efficient order management process.

                    the app offers users an intuitive way to upload images of clothing and instantly receive AI-generated text that captures the essence of the apparel. 
                    It provides an accessible interface for fashion content creators, marketers, or developers looking to explore computer vision in the fashion industry. 
                    With features like real-time image processing, smart hashtag generation, and a clean UI,
